Smart City Service Management System (Mini Project)
Project Description

The Smart City Service Management System is a Python-based mini project designed to manage essential city services using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

This system allows citizens to register and select multiple city services such as Water, Electricity, and Internet. Each service calculates its fee based on usage or plan type, and the system generates a final consolidated bill for the citizen.

The project demonstrates a real-world billing system and is ideal for beginners who want to understand how OOP concepts are applied in practical applications.

Objectives

To simulate a smart city service billing system

To apply core Object-Oriented Programming concepts

To manage multiple services efficiently using abstraction and polymorphism

OOP Concepts Used
1️⃣ Abstraction

Implemented using an abstract base class service

Common methods: start_service() and calculate_fee()

2️⃣ Inheritance

water_service, electricity_service, and internet_service inherit from the service class

3️⃣ Polymorphism

Each service class provides its own implementation of the calculate_fee() method

4️⃣ Encapsulation

The citizen class uses private attributes to protect data

Access is provided through getter methods

Features

Citizen registration (Name & Home Number)

Menu-driven service selection

Multiple services per citizen

Automatic bill calculation

Final bill generation

User-friendly console interface

Technologies Used

Python

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

abc module (Abstract Base Classes)

Services Included

Water Service (Meter reading based)

Electricity Service (Unit consumption based)

Internet Service (Basic / Pro plans)

Future Enhancements

Add more city services (Garbage, Emergency, Transport)

Store data using files or databases

Generate monthly service reports

Add admin-level management
